# hello-world
My first repository on Github

Hello everyone:
This is my first trip on github, my name is Tony and I come from China. Now I'm a graduate student in ECUST (east china university of science and technology) and major in materials science and technology. I'm quit confused about my future. So I want to learn something about programming so that I may have a nice job (or maybe not) in Shanghai.

Nice to meet all of you!
